=head1 NAME

EVP_VRFProve - Prove the correctness of a message digest with an input
EVP_VRFVerify - Verify a proof given by EVP_VRFProve

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 size_t EVP_VRFProve(EVP_PKEY *key, EVP_MD *md, const unsigned char *input, size_t len, unsigned char **hash, unsigned char **proof);
 int EVP_VRFVerify(EVP_PKEY *pkey, EVP_MD *md, const unsigned char *input, size_t isize, const unsigned char *hash, size_t hsize, const unsigned char *proof);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_VRFProve puts a proof of correctness of a message digest B<md> with input B<input> of size B<len> using a private key.
The digest and the proof of the message are put into B<hash> and B<proof> respectively. B<hash> must be allocated to the
message digest output size accordingly.

EVP_VRFVerify checks if B<proof> is valid for the given message digest (pseudorandom function) with the EVP_MD input and the output.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_VRFProve returns the size of B<proof>;
EVP_VRFVerify returns whether the check was correct.
